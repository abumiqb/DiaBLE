FIXME
-----

* Bubble:
   - Mac Catalyst stops receiving data from the read characteristic


TODO
----

* UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate methods
* save the app.settings (simply by using a property wrapper) and the OOP measurements (simply by using HealthKit's bloodGlucose)
* a global timer for the next reading
* log: limit to a number of readings; add the time when prepending "\t"; add a search field; record to a file
* landcape mode
* changing the calibration parameters updates a third purple curve
* a single slider for setting the desired glucose range and the alarms (see [SwiftExtensions](https://github.com/SwiftExtensions/SwiftUIExtensions))


PLANS / WISHES
---------------

* upload the OOP data to Nightscout
* an Apple Watch app connecting directly via Bluetooth
* a predictive meal log (see [WoofWoof](https://github.com/gshaviv/ninety-two))
