Experimenting with the Droplet, Bubble and MiaoMiao transmitters I bought for the Abbott FreeStyle Libre sensor and trying something new compared to the current apps:

* a universal **SwiftUI** application for iPhone, iPad and Mac Catalyst;
* scanning the Libre directly via **NFC**;
* using online servers for calibrating just like **Abbottâ€™s algorithm**;
* a detailed **log** to check the traffic from/to the BLE devices and remote servers.
