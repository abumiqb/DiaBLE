Experimenting with the Droplet, Bubble and MiaoMiao transmitters I bought for the Abbott FreeStyle Libre sensor.

* A playground to use and program directly on an iPad and in macOS Xcode (just copy&paste [Libre.swift](https://github.com/gui-dos/DiaBLE/blob/master/Libre.swift))
* A universal SwiftUI application for iPhone, iPad and Mac Catalyst from the same code base
* Scanning the Libre directly via NFC
* Using online servers for calibrating as for Abbottâ€™s algorithm
* A detailed log to see the messages from/to the BLE devices

Long term plans/wishes:

* An Apple Watch app communicating directly via Bluetooth
* Machine Learning to predict BG levels based on previous meals (see [Woof Woof](https://github.com/gshaviv/ninety-two))
* Closed loop with the upcoming Libre 2 (see [eDroplet](https://github.com/MarekM60/eDroplet))
