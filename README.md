Experimenting with the Droplet, Bubble and MiaoMiao transmitters I bought for the Abbott FreeStyle Libre sensor.

- [x] A **playground** to use DiaBLE and program it directly on an iPad as well as in macOS Xcode (just copy&pastee [Libre.swift](https://github.com/gui-dos/DiaBLE/blob/master/Libre.swift))
- [x] A universal **SwiftUI** application for iPhone, iPad and Mac Catalyst from the same code base
- [x] Scanning the Libre directly via **NFC**
- [x] Using online servers for calibrating as for **Abbottâ€™s algorithm**
- [x] A detailed **log** to see the messages from/to the BLE devices

Long term plans/wishes:

- [ ] An Apple Watch app communicating directly via Bluetooth
- [ ] Machine Learning to predict BG levels based on previous meals (see [Woof Woof](https://github.com/gshaviv/ninety-two))
- [ ] Closed loop with the upcoming Libre 2 (see [eDroplet](https://github.com/MarekM60/eDroplet))
